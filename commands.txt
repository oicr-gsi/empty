## Commands
This section lists command(s) run by "empty" workflow, a workflow used by GSI's infrastructure & Software Development team for testing.

* Workflow "empty" does the following:
** Prints to X lines to stdout and stderr.
** Waits for Y seconds (to simulate long running tasks).
** Exits/terminates with a user specified exit code.

<<<
    set -euo pipefail
    # Output n lines to stderr
    for (( i = 1; i <= ~{n}; i++ )) ; do
      echo "This is a place holder stdout line ${i}"
      echo "This is a place holder stderr line ${i}" 1>&2
    done
    sleep ~{runtime_seconds}
    exit ~{exitCode}
>>>
